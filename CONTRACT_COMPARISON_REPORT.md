---

## CHANGE 1: Updated Last Modified Date ✅

**Location:** Header
**Meeting Request:** Update to current date

### Original:

```

**Status:** ✅ **Implemented**
**Alignment:** Reflects the date changes were finalized.

---

## CHANGE 2: Removed Unilateral Amendment Language from Section 1 ✅

**Location:** Section 1 (INTRODUCTION)
**Meeting Request:** Max's Concern - "Lightning can just change the terms whenever they want"
**Alex's Response:** "This was meant for end-user terms, not consulting agreements. We can remove it."

### Original (REMOVED):
```
This Agreement can be updated from time to time in accordance with Section 15.1.
Client is responsible for regularly reviewing the most recent version of this
Agreement, which is published at: https://alexandria.wiki/terms-of-use-alexandria.
When Lightning changes this Agreement, the Last Modified date above will be updated.
```

### Revised:
```
By purchasing, accessing or using the Services offered by Lightning, as set out in
the Statement of Work, Client is confirming that Client has read, understands and
accepts Agreement.
```

**Status:** ✅ **Implemented**
**Impact:** Entire paragraph about unilateral updates and URL reference removed
**Alignment:** Directly addresses Max's concern that Lightning could change terms at will. Alex agreed this language doesn't belong in a consulting agreement.

---

## CHANGE 3: Enhanced Platform License with Deliverable Access Rights ✅

**Location:** Section 4.3 (Platform License Grant)
**Meeting Request:** Max's Concern - "What happens if we don't do a second SOW? Do we lose access to what we paid for?"
**Alex's Response:** "You should own the deliverable from a specific SOW. You shouldn't be perpetually dependent on our platform."

### Original:
```
Platform License Grant. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and payment of
applicable fees, Lightning grants to Client a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
revocable license to access and use the Lightning Platform solely for the purpose of
receiving the Services and operating the Ask Howie prototype during the Term.
```

### Revised:
```
Platform License Grant. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and payment of
applicable fees, Lightning grants to Client a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable
license to access and use the Lightning Platform solely for the purpose of receiving
the Services and operating the Ask Howie prototype.

    a. Deliverable Access. Upon completion and full payment for any Statement of Work,
       Client shall retain perpetual access to the specific deliverables and
       functionalities developed under that Statement of Work, even if no subsequent
       Statement of Work is executed or this Agreement terminates. Such continued access
       includes the right to use the delivered prototype or system in its delivered state
       without additional maintenance obligations from Lightning.

    b. Platform Continuity. Client's continued use of delivered systems may be subject
       to pass-through costs (such as third-party AI provider costs) at Lightning's
       actual cost, if applicable. Lightning shall not be obligated to provide
       maintenance, updates, or support for delivered systems beyond the term of the
       applicable Statement of Work unless separately agreed.

    c. Business Discontinuation. In the event Lightning ceases operations or
       discontinues the Lightning Platform, Lightning agrees to use commercially
       reasonable efforts to transfer or assign to Client the necessary rights and
       access to continue operating the delivered Ask Howie prototype and associated
       systems developed under this Agreement, or to provide Client with a reasonable
       transition period and technical documentation to enable Client to maintain the
       system independently or through a third party.
```

**Status:** ✅ **Implemented**
**Key Changes:**
- Removed "revocable" from license
- Removed "during the Term" limitation
- Added **perpetual access** to completed deliverables
- Added **Business Discontinuation** clause addressing what happens if Lightning shuts down
- Clarified pass-through costs but no maintenance obligations
- Client owns what they paid for, even if they don't continue with future SOWs

**Alignment:** Directly addresses Max's core concern about losing access to paid deliverables. Also addresses the scenario where Lightning goes out of business.

---

## CHANGE 4: Added Statement of Work Flexibility Clause ✅

**Location:** Section 4.6 (NEW SECTION)
**Meeting Request:** Max's Request - "Can we add language that the SOW structure is an example and open to interpretation based on early conversations?"
**Alex's Response:** "Yes, we can add that flexibility language."

### Original:
```
[Section did not exist]
```

### Revised:
```
6. Statement of Work Flexibility. The structure, format, and deliverables outlined in
   any Statement of Work represent one potential approach to achieving the project
   objectives. Lightning and Client acknowledge that the actual implementation may be
   adapted and reconstructed based on early project conversations, Client feedback, and
   evolving project requirements, provided both parties agree to such modifications in
   writing.
```

**Status:** ✅ **Implemented**
**Impact:** Provides contractual flexibility for adapting the SOW approach based on collaboration
**Alignment:** Directly implements Max's request for flexibility language, while maintaining requirement for written agreement on changes.

---

## CHANGE 5: Restricted Use of Client Feedback for Marketing ✅

**Location:** Section 6.5 (Feedback)
**Meeting Request:** Max's Concern - "This says you can use our feedback without restriction. Does that mean you can post it on your website?"
**Alex's Response:** "We would never do that obviously, but I can add language to clarify that we won't quote your written feedback without prior approval."

### Original:
```
5. Feedback. To the extent Client provides any feedback or suggestions to Lightning
   regarding the Services, such feedback shall be deemed non-confidential, and Lightning
   shall be free to use and exploit such feedback without restriction or obligation.
```

### Revised:
```
5. Feedback. To the extent Client provides any feedback or suggestions to Lightning
   regarding the Services, processes, or platform functionality, such feedback shall be
   deemed non-confidential with respect to process improvements and general insights,
   and Lightning shall be free to use such insights to improve its general methodologies
   and future client services without restriction or obligation. However, Lightning
   shall not quote, publish, or otherwise use Client's written feedback as testimonials,
   endorsements, or attributed statements in any marketing, promotional, or public-facing
   materials without Client's prior written consent.
```

**Status:** ✅ **Implemented**
**Key Changes:**
- Distinguishes between process insights (which Lightning can use) and testimonials (which require permission)
- Added explicit restriction on quoting, publishing, or using feedback for marketing without consent
- Preserves Lightning's right to learn from feedback for improvement purposes

**Alignment:** Balances Lightning's need to improve their processes with Max's concern about feedback being used for promotional purposes without permission.

---

## CHANGE 6: Removed Unilateral Amendment Language from Section 14.1 ✅

**Location:** Section 14.1 (Entire Agreement and Amendments)
**Meeting Request:** Continuation of Change #2 - removing unilateral change provisions
**Alex's Response:** "This doesn't belong in the consulting agreement."

### Original (REMOVED):
```
Lightning may change any part of this Agreement (including any terms or documents
incorporated by reference in this Agreement) at any time by posting the revised terms
on Lightning website. It is important for Client to review this Agreement before using
the Services and from time to time. The updated Agreement will be effective as of the
time of posting, and Client's continued use of the Services after any such changes are
effective will constitute Client's consent to such changes. Except for changes made by
Lightning as described here, no other amendment or modification of this Agreement will
be effective unless set forth in the Statement of Work, or as amendments, modifications
or addendums to this Agreement and must be in writing and signed by each party's
authorized representatives or, as appropriate, agreed through electronic means provided
by Lightning.
```

### Revised:
```
1. Entire Agreement and Amendments. This Agreement and the Statement of Work (including
   the addendums, amendments, or attachments) constitute the entire agreement of the
   Parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior
   written and oral agreements or understandings relating to such subject matter. No
   amendment or modification of this Agreement will be effective unless set forth in the
   Statement of Work, or as amendments, modifications or addendums to this Agreement and
   must be in writing and signed by each party's authorized representatives or, as
   appropriate, agreed through electronic means provided by Lightning.
```

**Status:** ✅ **Implemented**
**Impact:** Entire paragraph about unilateral changes via website posting removed
**Alignment:** Completes the removal of unilateral amendment provisions (also removed from Section 1). Now all changes require written agreement.

---

## CHANGE 7: Revised Acceptance Criteria to Be More Flexible ✅

**Location:** Exhibit A - Statement of Work (Acceptance Criteria)
**Meeting Request:** Max's Concern - "The 10-day rule is too rigid. What if we're on vacation for 10 days?"
**Alex's Response:** "This is meant as an anti-ghosting provision. We can focus on good faith effort and reasonable timeframes instead of strict days."

### Original:
```
Acceptance Criteria

Each milestone deliverable will be considered accepted upon Client's written approval
or 10 business days after delivery if no written feedback is provided.
```

### Revised:
```
Acceptance Criteria

Each milestone deliverable will be considered accepted upon Client's written approval.
If Client requires additional time to review deliverables or is temporarily unavailable,
Client shall provide written acknowledgment to Lightning indicating the expected
timeframe for full review and feedback. Lightning will make good faith efforts to
accommodate reasonable review periods.

Deliverables shall be deemed accepted if Client does not provide substantive written
feedback within twenty (20) business days of delivery, provided that:

(a) Lightning has made good faith efforts to ensure Client received and had opportunity
    to review the deliverable;
(b) Client has not provided notice of being unavailable or needing additional review time;
    and
(c) The delay in feedback is not due to any deficiency in the deliverable or failure by
    Lightning to meet the specifications outlined in the Statement of Work.

This provision is intended to prevent indefinite delay while respecting both parties'
good faith obligations. Simple acknowledgment of receipt (such as "received, will review"
or "on vacation, will review upon return") shall constitute written feedback sufficient
to pause the acceptance timeline.
```

**Status:** ✅ **Implemented**
**Key Changes:**
- Extended from **10 business days → 20 business days**
- Added flexibility for client to request additional time
- Simple acknowledgment (like "on vacation") pauses the timeline
- Added good faith provisions
- Made it clear this is anti-ghosting, not a rigid deadline
- Added conditions (a), (b), (c) to ensure fairness

**Alignment:** Directly addresses Max's vacation scenario while preserving Lightning's protection against indefinite delays.
